    "text": "Reproducible Science Workshop\n\n\nOrganization For Tropical Studies\n\n\n\nMarcelo Araya-Salas, PhD\n\n\n\nApril, 2024\n\n\n\n\n \nScientific production currently suffers from a lack of reproducibility (the ability to recreate a study based on published information), due to the poor documentation of the methods and analyses used, as well as the lack of access to the data generated. Biology has not escaped this crisis of scientific reproducibility, which affects the credibility of our community. Fortunately, in response to this crisis, a multitude of tools have been developed, in most cases freely available, to increase the transparency and accessibility of data supporting the conclusions of scientific studies. Making these tools available to the scientific community and encouraging their use early in the training of researchers is critical to solving the reproducibility crisis. These tools revolve around three main axes: 1) online repositories for sharing data and research products, 2) open access digital tools, and 3) the implementation of good data management and analysis practices**. These three axes represent the modules in which the course is organized. This course aims to deepen the use of tools (mostly digital) as well as good practices along each of the common stages of the each of the stages common to the development of research projects in biology.\n\nObjetives\n\nTo raise awareness of the current problem of scientific reproducibility and its implications for the production of knowledge and its legitimacy in society.\nTo provide students with free software computational tools that facilitate the documentation and accessibility of research.\nIdentify processes at different stages of scientific research where practices that facilitate reproducibility can be adopted.\nProvide students with experience in applying the tools provided through practices."

    "text": "3 Elements of the R language\n\nVectors\nLists\nMatrices\nData Frames\nFunctions (including operators)\nAttributes\nTables\nArrays\nEnvironments\n\nData structure\nThe basic data structure in R is the vector. There are two basic types of vectors: atomic vectors and lists.\nThey have three common properties:\n\nType, typeof() (~ class/mode)\nLength, length() (number of elements)\nAttributes, attributes() (metadata)\n\nThey differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneous\nHeterogeneous\n\n\n\n\n1d\nAtomic vector\nList\n\n\n2d\nMatrix\nData frame\n\n\nnd\nArray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nR has no 0-dimensional elements (scalars). Individual numbers or strings are actually vectors of length one.\nAtomic vectors\nTypes of atomic vectors:\n\nLogical (boolean)\nInteger\nNumeric (double)\nCharacter\n\nVectors are built using c():\n\n\nCode\n\nx &lt;- 1\nx1 &lt;- c(1)\n\nall.equal(x, x1)\n## [1] TRUE\n\nclass(x)\n## [1] \"numeric\"\n\ny &lt;- \"something\"\n\nclass(y)\n## [1] \"character\"\n\nw &lt;- 1L\n\nclass(w)\n## [1] \"integer\"\n \nz &lt;- TRUE\n\nclass(z)\n## [1] \"logical\"\n\nq &lt;- factor(1)\n\nclass(q)\n## [1] \"factor\"\n\n\n \nVectors can only contain entries of the same type. Different types will be coerced to the most flexible type:\n\n\nCode\n\nv &lt;- c(10, 11, 12, 13)\n\nclass(v)\n## [1] \"numeric\"\n\nis.integer(v)\n## [1] FALSE\n\ny &lt;- c(\"Amazona\", \"Ara\", \"Eupsittula\", \"Myiopsitta\")\n\nclass(y)\n## [1] \"character\"\n\nis.integer(y)\n## [1] FALSE\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3, \"Myiopsitta\")\n\nx\n## [1] \"1\"          \"2\"          \"3\"          \"Myiopsitta\"\n\nclass(x)\n## [1] \"character\"\n\n\n \nMissing values are specified with NA, which is a logical vector of length 1. NA will always be coerced to the correct type if used inside c():\n\n\nCode\n\nv &lt;- c(10, 11, 12, 13, NA)\n\nclass(v)\n## [1] \"numeric\"\n\nv &lt;- c(letters[1:3], NA)\n\nclass(v)\n## [1] \"character\"\n\n\n \nLists\nCan contain objects of different classes and sizes. Lists are built using list():\n\n\nCode\nl &lt;- list(ID = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"), \n          size = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), \n          observed = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))\n\nl\n\n\n$ID\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\"\n\n$size\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n$observed\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nCode\nclass(l)\n\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nCode\nstr(l)\n\n\nList of 3\n $ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n $ size    : num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n $ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n… and dimensions:\n\n\nCode\nl &lt;- list(ID = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"), \n          size = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), \n          observed = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE), \n          l)\n\nstr(l)\n\n\nList of 4\n $ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n $ size    : num [1:6] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n $         :List of 3\n  ..$ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n  ..$ size    : num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  ..$ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nCode\nl2 &lt;- list(l, l)\n\nstr(l2)\n\n\nList of 2\n $ :List of 4\n  ..$ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n  ..$ size    : num [1:6] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n  ..$ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n  ..$         :List of 3\n  .. ..$ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n  .. ..$ size    : num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  .. ..$ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n $ :List of 4\n  ..$ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n  ..$ size    : num [1:6] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n  ..$ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n  ..$         :List of 3\n  .. ..$ ID      : chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n  .. ..$ size    : num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  .. ..$ observed: logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n \nAttributes\nObjects can have attributes. Attributes allow to store metadata about the object. Attributes are kind of named lists. Attributes can be accessed individually with attr() or all at once (as a list) with attributes():\n\n\nCode\ny &lt;- 1:10\n\nmean(y)\n\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nCode\nattr(y, \"my_attribute\") &lt;- \"This is an attribute\"\n\n\nattr(y, \"my_attribute\")\n\n\n[1] \"This is an attribute\"\n\n\nCode\nstr(y)\n\n\n int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n - attr(*, \"my_attribute\")= chr \"This is an attribute\"\n\n\n \nMost attributes are lost when modifying a vector:\n\n\nCode\nattributes(y[1])\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n \nThe only attributes not lost are the three most important:\n\nNames, a character vector giving each element a name, described in names\nDimensions\nClass\n\n\n\n\nCode\nw &lt;- structure(c(a =1, b = 2), my_attribute = \"This is not an apple\")\n\nattributes(w)\n\n\n$names\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n$my_attribute\n[1] \"This is not an apple\"\n\n\nCode\nattributes(w[1])\n\n\n$names\n[1] \"a\"\n\n\nCode\nclass(w[1])\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n \nFactors\nAttributes are used to define factors. A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data.\nFactors are built on top of integer vectors using two attributes:\n\nclass “factor”: makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors\nlevels: defines the set of allowed values\n\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\"))\nx\n\n\n[1] a b b a\nLevels: a b\n\n\nCode\nlevels(x)\n\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\nCode\nstr(x)\n\n\n Factor w/ 2 levels \"a\",\"b\": 1 2 2 1\n\n\n \nFactors look like character vectors but they are actually integers:\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\"))\n\nc(x)\n\n\n[1] a b b a\nLevels: a b\n\n\n \nMatrices\nAll entries are of the same type:\n\n\nCode\nm &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13), nrow = 2)\n\ndim(m)\n\n\n[1] 2 3\n\n\nCode\nm\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3   12\n[2,]    2   11   13\n\n\nCode\nclass(m)\n\n\n[1] \"matrix\" \"array\" \n\n\nCode\nm &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12,\"13\"), nrow = 2)\nm\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,] \"1\"  \"3\"  \"12\"\n[2,] \"2\"  \"11\" \"13\"\n\n\n \nData frames\nSpecial case of lists. Can contain entries of different types:\n\n\nCode\nm &lt;- data.frame(ID = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"), \n                size = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), \n                observed = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))\n\ndim(m)\n\n\n[1] 5 3\n\n\nCode\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nsize\nobserved\n\n\n\n\na\n1\nFALSE\n\n\nb\n2\nTRUE\n\n\nc\n3\nFALSE\n\n\nd\n4\nFALSE\n\n\ne\n5\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclass(m)\n\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nCode\nis.data.frame(m)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nCode\nis.list(m)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nCode\nstr(m)\n\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ ID      : chr  \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" ...\n $ size    : num  1 2 3 4 5\n $ observed: logi  FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n \nBut vectors should have the same length:\n\n\nCode\nm &lt;- data.frame(ID = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"), \n                size = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), \n                observed = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))\n\n\nError in data.frame(ID = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"), size = c(1, 2, 3, : arguments imply differing number of rows: 5, 6"

Optional but advised.\nMake a directory called “OTS_REU_OS_2024”, this will be your working directory for the course.\nOpen RStudio and select the tab “Tools” then “Global Options” (last option). Select the “Code” option, then select the box for “Soft-wrap R source files”.\nAlso in RStudio: Select the “Pane Layout” option and move “Source” to the top left pane and “Console” to the top right pane. For those of you unfamiliar with RStudio, the source is your script, where you save code in a physical file (usually .R script) and the console prints the output of the code you run from the source. You can write code in the console, but it will not be saved in a physical file. This layout allocates more screen space to the most useful panes. Hit “Apply” and “Ok”.\nAlso in RStudio: Go back up to the “File” tab and select “New Project”, then select the “OTS_REU_OS_2024” directory.\nNow in the R console in RStudio: Run the following code to install some R packages (remove the packages first if you have them installed already).\n\n\n\nCode\n# install package to install packages\ninstall.packages(\"sketchy\") \n\n# load sketchy\nlibrary(sketchy)\n\n# install packages\nload_packages(\n  packages = c(\n    \"rmarkdown\",\n    \"knitr\",\n    \"kableExtra\",\n    \"rmdformats\",\n    \"revealjs\",\n    \"rticles\",\n    \"tufte\",\n    \"ggplot2\",\n    \"viridis\",\n    github = \"hadley/emo\",\n    github = \"benmarwick/rrtools\",\n    github = \"CrumpLab/vertical\",\n    github = \"crsh/papaja\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nInstall git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)\nCreate a github account (https://github.com/signup)\nInstall Github Desktop (https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)\nOn Github Desktop log in into your github account using github\n\n\nA few tips to make sure you will take full advantage of the course:\n\nIdeally, read the materials ahead of time (I know! it’s time consuming)\nMake sure you have anything you need before the start of the class\nBe ready a few minutes before the start of the class\nTry to focus as much as possible in the course, close other programs or unnecessary internet browser tabs (i.e. instagram, twitter, etc).

I am the developer and maintainer of the R packages warbleR and Rraven that provide functions to streamline high-throughput acoustic analysis of animal sounds, aiming to simplify the use of R for bioacoustic research. More recently I released the R packages baRulho, to quantify acoustic signal transmission and degradation, ohun, to optimize automatic detection and PhenotypeSpace for quantifying multidimensional trait spaces.

    "text": "2 Tools for Reproducible Programming\n \n\n2.1 Literate Programming\n\nInvolves documenting in detail what the problem consists of, how it is solved, how and why a certain flow of analysis was adopted, how it was optimized (if it was optimized), and how it was implemented in the programming language.\nDynamic reports in R facilitate the use of literate programming to document data handling and statistical analysis (this file you are reading right now is a dynamic report created in R).\nThe main way R facilitates reproducible research is by using a document that is a combination of content and data analysis code.\nWe will discuss dynamic reports later as a tool to facilitate literate programming.\n\n\n\n2.2 Reproducible Environments\n\nReproducibility is also about ensuring that someone else can reuse your code to get the same results.\nFor this, you need to provide more than just the code and the data.\nDocumenting and managing your project’s dependencies correctly can be complicated. However, even simple documentation that helps others understand the setup you used can have a significant impact.\nIdeally, you should document the exact versions of all packages and software you used and the operating system.\n\n\n\n2.3 Session Information\nThe simplest way to document the environment (R + packages and their versions) in which an analysis was done is by using the sessionInfo function:\n\n\nR version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\nRunning under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.10.0\nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.10.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=es_CR.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=es_CR.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=es_CR.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=es_CR.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] lubridate_1.9.3   emo_0.0.0.9000    digest_0.6.35     crayon_1.5.2     \n [5] assertthat_0.2.1  lifecycle_1.0.4   jsonlite_1.8.8    magrittr_2.0.3   \n [9] evaluate_0.23     stringi_1.8.3     rlang_1.1.3       cli_3.6.2        \n[13] rstudioapi_0.15.0 vctrs_0.6.5       generics_0.1.3    rmarkdown_2.26   \n[17] tools_4.1.2       stringr_1.5.1     glue_1.7.0        htmlwidgets_1.6.4\n[21] purrr_1.0.2       xfun_0.43         yaml_2.3.8        fastmap_1.1.1    \n[25] compiler_4.1.2    timechange_0.3.0  htmltools_0.5.8.1 knitr_1.46       \n\n\n \nHowever, this documentation does not necessarily make the analyses replicable since package versions often get updated and even some packages may not be available after a while.\n \n\n\n2.4 Packrat: Reproducible Package Management in R\nR packages (and their specific versions) used in an analysis can be difficult to replicate:\n\nHave you ever had to use trial and error to figure out which R packages you need to install to make someone else’s code work?\nHave you ever updated a package to make your project’s code work, only to find out that the updated package causes another project’s code to stop working?\n\nWith the packrat package, projects have several useful features in terms of reproducibility:\n\nIsolation: Installing a new or updated package for a project will not affect your other projects and vice versa. That’s because packrat gives each project its own private package library.\nPortable: Easily move your projects from one computer to another, even on different platforms. packrat makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.\nReproducible: packrat records the exact versions of the package it depends on and ensures that those exact versions are installed wherever you go.\n\n\n2.4.1 Using Packrat\n\nOf course, first, we need to install the packrat package in R:\n\n\n\nCode\n# install package\ninstall.packages(\"packrat\")\n\n\n \n\nNow, let’s create a new R project (in a new directory).\nAfter creating a project (or moving to an existing one) we can start monitoring and managing packages with packrat like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n# start packrat in project\npackrat::init(path = \"/project/directory\")\n\n\n \nIf the working directory is set as the project directory, it is not necessary to define the ‘path’:\n\n\nCode\n# start packrat in project\npackrat::init()\n\n\n \nAfter this, the use of packages in this project will be managed by packrat (you will see some differences in what the R console prints when installing packages). So, we are already using packrat. A packrat project contains some additional files and directories. The init() function creates these files and directories if they do not already exist:\n\npackrat/packrat.lock: lists the precise versions of the package that were used to satisfy the dependencies, including dependencies of dependencies (should never be edited manually!).\npackrat/packrat.opts: Project-specific packrat options. These can be consulted and configured with get_opts and set_opts; see “packrat-options” for more information.\npackrat/lib/: Private package library for this project.\npackrat/src/: Source packages of all dependencies that have been reported to packrat.\n.Rprofile: Tells R to use the private package library when started from the project directory.\n\nThe only difference with other projects is that projects using packrat have their own package library. This is located in /project/directory/packrat/lib. For example, let’s install a couple of new packages, they can be some you are familiar with or these ones we have here as an example:\n\n\nCode\ninstall.packages(\"fun\")\n\n\n \nEvery time we install one or more packages, it is necessary to update the tracking status of packrat. We do this as follows:\n\n\nCode\n# check current status\npackrat::status()\n\n# update packrat in project\npackrat::snapshot()\n\n\n \nWith this package, we can play in R:\n\n\nCode\n# example of an irrelevant game X\nlibrary(fun)\n\nif (.Platform$OS.type == \"windows\") x11() else x11(type = \"Xlib\")\n\nmine_sweeper()\n\n\n \nOr take an Alzheimer’s test:\n\n\nCode\n# another slightly less irrelevant game\nx = alzheimer_test()\n\n\n \nIf we remove a package that we used in the project, we can reinstall it using restore():\n\n\nCode\n# remove\nremove.packages(\"fun\")\n\n# check current status\npackrat::status()\n\n# restore\npackrat::restore()\n\n\nNew packages can be installed:\n\n\nCode\n# install\ninstall.packages(\"cowsay\")\n\n# load\nlibrary(cowsay)\n\n# diagram\nsay(\"Hello world!\")\n\n# random echo\nsay(\"rms\")\n\n\n\n\n\n -------------- \nHello world! \n --------------\n    \\\n      \\\n        \\\n            |\\___/|\n          ==) ^Y^ (==\n            \\  ^  /\n             )=*=(\n            /     \\\n            |     |\n           /| | | |\\\n           \\| | |_|/\\\n      jgs  //_// ___/\n               \\_)\n  \n\n\n\n\nCode\n# random echo\nsay(\"rms\")\n\n\n \n\n\n\n -------------- \nSome people say M-x psychoanalyse-pinhead is a merely a program.

Several proposals have emerged to try to solve reproducibility issues in computational data analysis.\nUnfortunately, this is further complicated by the lack of formal instruction in data handling and structuring for analysis that scientists (we) suffer from. This makes it almost inevitable that there is little consistency and even chaos in our data organization for research projects. This is an example of a “poorly structured” project (to use a euphemism):\nThis (lack of) “structure” is impractical. Unfortunately, it is likely not an isolated case.\nIn this tutorial, we will discuss some of the tools that have been developed to address these problems that have been developed in R."

    "text": "1 Folder structure formats\nHere you will find a short and by no means exhaustive list of examples of folder structures for data analysis projects.\n \n\n1.1 “Noble” format\nNoble (2009) proposes a specific data structure for bioinformatics data (although it could be adapted to other needs):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis structure, however, uses folders with dates to keep the chronological order of the analysis, something that should be documented with a version control system (i.e., Git). Therefore, it is not very functional.\n \n\n\n1.2 “R-dir” format\nIn this blog the following format is proposed:\n\n\nCode\n  analysis_r-dir/\n    |\n    ├── code/\n    │   ├── processed       \n    │   └── raw  \n    ├── data/\n    │   ├── raw/\n    │   └── clean/\n    ├── figures/            \n    │   ├── exploratory       \n    │   └── final  \n    └── text/\n        ├── final\n        └── notes\n\n\n \nThe main folders include:\n\ncode: contains all R scripts (or other languages); raw ones go in “./code/raw” and processed ones in “./processed/clean”\ndata: any type of data, raw ones go in “./data/raw” and processed ones in “./data/clean”\nfigures: exploratory figures go in “./figures/exploratory” and final ones in “./figures/final”\n\nThis format can be copied (or cloned) from its GitHub repository.\nThe proposed structure is similar to others found on the web. Variations depend somewhat on the type of data and the format of the obtained results (i.e., images vs. phylogenetic trees).\n \n\n\n1.3 “Moldach” format\nThis format is very similar to the previous one, and it is mainly included to highlight the common factors among the different proposed formats:\n\n\nCode\nproject_name\n|--data\n    |--raw\n        |--file_001.xlsx\n        |--file_002.gen\n        |--file_002.sample\n    |--tidy\n        |--file_001-cleaned.csv\n|--refs\n    |--Oldach_2018.pdf\n|--analysis\n    |--01-analysis.Rmd\n|--figures\n    |--01-scatterplot.jpg\n    |--01-correlation.png\n|--R\n    |--exploratory_analysis.R\n    |--pdf_scraper.R\n|--name_of_project.Rproj\n|--run_all.R\n\n\n \nThe main differences with the “r-dir” format are the use of a references folder and the code to compile the compendium in the root directory.\nThe format is described in detail in this blog and can be cloned from its GitHub repository."

One of these is the vertical package (Vourre & Crump 2020). Its authors propose several advantages of using this format to share research products (from experiment scripts to articles, presentations, and posters):\n\n\nR packages have a standardized and well-organized file structure that is useful for organizational purposes\nResearchers often develop custom functions for analysis, and putting them in an R package makes it easier to share the functions\nR packages can include project data and provide a natural way to document the data using the same schemas for documenting R functions\nR packages include various documents through the vignettes folder, which could in principle include various formats for communicating research, such as a manuscript or a set of slides written in R Markdown\nR packages can be automatically converted into websites via pkgdown, providing an attractive format for sharing research-related materials\n\n\nSin embargo el uso de este formato puede generar mas problemas de los que ayuda a resolver. Aquí enumero algunas de las incongruencias:\nHowever, using this format can generate more problems than it helps to solve. Here I list some of the inconsistencies:\n\n\nFunctions should be used once or in a single point in the analysis flow, so why compile and document them in such detail?\nDocumenting packages and the functions within them is complex\nDESCRIPTION duplicates effort and information from README and demands greater knowledge of package-specific format and conventions\nMaking data available when loading the environment does not provide advantages and makes the data less accessible outside of R (i.e., there is no gain from using data(\"database\") instead of read.csv(\"database.csv\"))\nPackages are for sharing tools that are used repeatedly. Data analysis reproduction occurs once or a few times\nR packages have folders that have no functionality in data analysis (“man”, “vignettes”, “inst”)\nIntegrating the components of a package (necessary to be able to use continuous integration) requires other files with complex structures and conventions that imply an unnecessarily steep learning curve\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the problems associated with using packages as templates, we recommend reading this post (McBrain 2020)."

    "section": "3 R Packages for Compendium Generation",
    "text": "3 R Packages for Compendium Generation\n\n3.1 vertical\nThe vertical package provides a structured workflow based on the folder structure and continuous integration of R packages for creating and sharing research materials and resources as an R package (Matthew et al. 2020). The package can be installed and/or loaded from GitHub like this (it is not yet on CRAN(?)):\n\n\nCode\n# install.packages('devtools')\n\nremotes::install_github(\"CrumpLab/vertical\")\n\nlibrary(vertical)\n\n\n \nYou will also need other packages if you want to make use of functionalities like writing articles and generating presentations:\n\n\nCode\n# install papaja\ndevtools::install_github(\"crsh/papaja\")\n\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::tlmgr_update()\n\n# if unable to generate articles try this as a last resort\n# update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)\n\n\n \n\n3.1.1 ‘vertical’ workflow\nInstalling the vertical package adds a new project template to RStudio (RStudio must be restarted after installing vertical for it to recognize the template). Users can start a new “vertical” project from RStudio by choosing the option when creating a new project. By default, a “vertical” project is structured as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe new project contains a more complex skeleton than that of an R package:\n\nFolders for raw data, data, and vignettes\nA _pkgdown.yml file to control the parameters of the website when processed with pkgdown\nAdditional folders for project research products like “experiments”, “manuscript”, “model”, “posters”, and “slides”.\n\nBy default, vertical includes R Markdown templates from other packages within each folder to create each type of content. As a result, vertical suggests using R as a single-source solution for creating research products.\n\n\n3.1.2 Creating a ‘vertical’ project\nAfter installing vertical, restart RStudio, then follow these steps to start a new vertical project. When choosing a name, it must be a valid R package name. For example, the name must contain letters, numbers, or periods (e.g., my.name), but not periods at the end. This means no spaces, hyphens, or underscores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can also create a ‘vertical’ project from the console, see the documentation of vertical_project() for more options. This brings up the R project templates window from the console:\n\n\nCode\nvertical::vertical_project()\n\n\n \nThis is the folder structure it generates:\n\n\nCode\n  vertical_comp/\n    |\n    ├── data_raw/\n    ├── manuscripts/\n    │   ├── manuscript.Rmd       \n    │   └── r-references.bib  \n    ├── posters/            \n    ├── R/            \n    ├── slides/            \n    └── vignettes/            \n\n\n \n\n\n\nExercise 1\n1.1 Create a compendium using vertical\n\n1.2 Modify the R markdown file in ‘./manuscripts/’ and generate the HTML again\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3.2 rrtools\nThe goal of rrtools is “to provide instructions, templates, and functions for creating a basic compendium suitable for writing reproducible articles or reports in R” (Marwick 2019). This package documents key steps and provides useful functions to quickly create a new research compendium.\nrrtools provides a template for academic writing using R Markdown and bookdown. It also allows for the isolation of your computational environment using Docker, version control of packages using `MR\nAN, and continuous integration usingTravis`:\n\n\nCode\ndevtools::install_github(\"benmarwick/rrtools\")\n\nlibrary(rrtools)\n\n\n \nWe can start a compendium with rrtools like this (do not run it if you are within an Rstudio project):\n\n\nCode\nrrtools::use_compendium(\"package_name\")\n\n\n \nYou need to update the DESCRIPTION file (located in the compendium directory) to include accurate metadata. For example, the ‘imports’ section should have the names of the packages used in the code in our compendium (‘Imports: warbleR, baRulho, NatureSounds’).\nWe can add a license to the compendium like this:\n\n\nCode\nrrtools::create_compendium(\"package_name\")\n\n\n \nThis adds the license to DESCRIPTION and generates a LICENSE file with license details. It defaults to using the MIT license although other licenses can be defined.\nUnlike vertical, rrtools does not generate all the basic folders necessary for a compendium. We can create these folders like this:\n\n\nCode\nrrtools::use_analysis()\n\n\n \nThis generates the “./analysis” folder with the following structure:\n\n\nCode\n  analysis/\n    |\n    ├── paper/\n    │   ├── paper.Rmd       # document to generate the article\n    │   └── references.bib  # references in bibtex format\n    ├── figures/            # figures produced by rmarkdown\n    |\n    ├── data/\n    │   ├── raw_data/       # raw (original) data\n    │   └── derived_data/   # processed data\n    |\n    └── templates\n        ├── journal-of-archaeological-science.csl # citation style\n        |                   \n        ├── template.docx   # generated article template\n        └── template.Rmd    # article rmd template\n\n\n \nThe README.Rmd file can be created like this:\n\n\nCode\nrrtools::use_readme_rmd()\n\n\n \nThe generated README includes a template that shows how to cite your project (it should be edited to include the correct title and DOI). It also contains license, figures, code, and data information for your compendium.\nThis function also adds two other Rmd files: a code of conduct for users (CONDUCT.md) and one with basic instructions for people who want to contribute to your project (CONTRIBUTING.md).\nIt also offers functions like rrtools::use_dockerfile() and rrtools::use_travis() to facilitate continuous integration. Visit the package’s github repository for more detail.\n \n\n\n3.3 workflowr\nThe workflowr package aims to help researchers “organize their analyses in a way that promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and sharing of results” (Blischak et al. 2019). workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing documented and versioned results.\nUnlike rrtools and vertical, workflowr does not emulate the folder structure of R packages, which simplifies its use and makes its structure more intuitive from the researcher’s point of view.\nThese are some of the features of the package detailed on its github site:\n\nOrganized\n\nProvides a project template with organized subdirectories\nMixes code and results with R Markdown\nUses Git to version both source code and results\n\nReproducible\n\nDisplays the version of the code used to create each result\nRuns each analysis in an isolated R session\nRecords the session information for each analysis\nSets the same seed for generating random numbers for each analysis\n\nShareable\n\nCreates a website to present the results of your research\nDocuments how to host your website for free via GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages\nCreates links to previous versions of results\n\n\n \nYou can install the package like this:\n\n\nCode\ninstall.packages(\"workflowr\")\n\nlibrary(workflowr)\n\n\n \nTo create a project with workflowr, first you must set up git with the wflow_git_config() function and then start it with wflow_start():\n\n\nCode\n# Set up Git\nwflow_git_config(user.name = \"full name\", user.email = \"email@domain\")\n\n# Start a project\nwflow_start(\"my_compendium\")\n\n\n \nThis is the folder structure of the ‘workflowr’ compendium:\n\n\nCode\nmy_compendium/\n├── .gitignore\n├── .Rprofile\n├── _workflowr.yml\n├── analysis/\n│   ├── about.Rmd\n│   ├── index.Rmd\n│   ├── license.Rmd\n│   └── _site.yml\n├── code/\n│   ├── README.md\n├── data/\n│   └── README.md\n├── docs/\n├── myproject.Rproj\n├── output/\n│   └── README.md\n└── README.md\n\n\n \nAnd with this code we can compile the compendium site:\n\n\nCode\nwflow_build()\n\n\nThis command ‘knits’ all R Markdown files in the ‘./analysis’ folder and saves the corresponding HTML files in ‘./docs’. Each file is created in its own external R session to avoid potential conflicts between analyses (this is the default behavior of Rmd files). It also opens the local copy of the compendium site in the internet browser. We can also take a look at the local copy of the site like this:\n\n\nCode\n# view compendium site\nwflow_view()\n\n\n \nworkflowr distinguishes between R Markdown files that are published and those that are not published. A published file is included on the online website; while the HTML file of an unpublished R Markdown file can only be viewed on the local computer. Since the project was just initiated, there are no published files. To see the project status of workflowr, we should use wflow_status():\n\n\nCode\n# check current status\nwflow_status()\n\n\n \nIf we want to make the HTMLs public, we should use the wflow_publish() function and provide the names of the R markdowns that generate them with the files argument. Additionally, we need to add a message for the ‘commit’ accompanying the changes generated when synchronized with the remote copy:\n\n\nCode\n# publish rmds\nwflow_publish(files = c(\"analysis/index.Rmd\", \"analysis/about.Rmd\",\n    \"analysis/license.Rmd\"), message = \"my first commit of the compendium\")\n\n\n \nAt this point, we have created a versioned website locally\n. The next step is to put it in an online repository (i.e., GitHub or GitLab). To upload and/or synchronize the compendium (including the website) to GitHub, we use the wflow_use_github() function. The only argument it requires is the username:\n\n\nCode\nwflow_use_github(\"my_compendium\")\n\n\n \nThe “getting started” tutorial of workflowr provides more details for each of the steps to generate compendia with this package. The documentation is quite comprehensive, including several other tutorials for customizing the compendia and their websites. Here you can find the list of tutorials.\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n2.1 Create a compendium using workflowr\n\n2.2 Build the compendium site\n\n\n \n\n\n3.4 sketchy\nThis is a package we are currently developing. At the moment, it only allows creating folder structures and generating an Rmarkdown to write the article. It also allows visualizing the compendium structure in the console. The main difference from the other packages is that it does not adhere to a single structure; it provides several alternative structures and also allows the user to generate their own formats.\nTo use it, you must first install it from github like this:\n\n\nCode\n# From github\ndevtools::install_github(\"maRce10/sketchy\")\n\n# load package\nlibrary(sketchy)\n\n\nThe package comes with 13 folder structures. You can use them with the compendium_skeleton() function. The function creates the folders/subfolders and prints a diagram of the compendium in the console:\n\n\n3.5 Basic Compendium\n\n\nCode\npath = tempdir()\n\nmake_compendium(name = \"project_x\", path = path, format = compendiums$basic$skeleton)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(in the example, a temporary directory is used but this should be changed to the directory where you want to create the compendium)\n\n\n3.6 Alternative Formats\nYou can use formats from other sources. In this case, we use the one from Wilson et al. (2017):\n\n\nCode\nmake_compendium(name = \"project_y\", path = path, format = compendiums$wilson$skeleton)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can also add comments to each folder to explain its contents:\n\n\nCode\nmake_compendium(name = \"project_z\", path = path, format = compendiums$large_compendium$skeleton,\n    comments = compendiums$large_compendium$comments)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhen you create a compendium that includes a folder called “manuscript,” the package automatically adds the “manuscript_template.Rmd” file that can be used to write the project’s article.\nThe idea is to include functions to identify large files that cannot be uploaded to github and be able to upload them to other repositories (i.e., figshare or zenodo).\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n3.1 Create a compendium with a custom structure using sketchy\n\n3.2 Add comments to each folder"

    "text": "0.2 Git: Version Control\nA version control system tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be retrieved at any time.\n\n\n\n\nTaken from Bryan 2018\n\nVersion control:\n\nKeeps track of changes made\nFacilitates collaborative work\nAllows knowing who changed what and when\nAllows reverting changes\n\nGit does not need a permanent connection to a central repository and allows asynchronous work of collaborators.\n \n\n0.2.1 Installing Git\n\n\n0.2.1.1 Install Git on Linux\nGit was originally developed on the Linux operating system. Therefore, it makes sense that it’s easier to set up to run on Linux. You can install Git on Linux via the package management tool that comes with your distribution:\n\nGit packages are available using apt\nIt’s a good idea to ensure you’re running the latest version. To do this, navigate to the command prompt terminal and run the following command to ensure everything is up to date: sudo apt update\nTo install Git, run the following command: sudo apt install git-all\nOnce the command output is complete, you can check the installation by typing: git version\n\n\n\n\n0.2.1.2 Install Git on Windows\n\nFind the latest installer for Git for Windows and download the latest version\nOnce the installer has started, follow the instructions provided on the Git Setup Wizard screen until installation is complete\nOpen the Windows terminal or Git Bash\nType the git version to verify that Git is installed (git version)\n\n\nNote: git-scm is recommended to download Git for Windows. The advantage of downloading Git from git-scm is that it uses the latest version of Git and includes Git Bash.\n\n\n\n\n0.2.1.3 Install Git on macOS\nMost versions of macOS have Git installed. However, if you don’t have Git installed, you can install the latest version of Git using one of these methods:\n\n0.2.1.3.1 Install Git from an installer\n\nRun git --version in the terminal, if it’s not installed yet you will be prompted to install it\nOnce the installer has started, follow the instructions provided until installation is complete\n\n\n\n0.2.1.3.2 Install Git from Homebrew\nHomebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you already have Homebrew installed, you can follow these steps to install Git:\n\nOpen a terminal window and install Git using the following command: brew install git\nOnce the command output is complete, you can verify the installation by typing: git --version\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n0.2.2 Using Git for Version Control\nGit is typically used from a terminal (console where code is run). In Windows, it is recommended to use the gitbash console. In Unix-based operating systems (macOS and Linux), it can be used directly from the default terminal.\n \n\n0.2.2.1 Steps\n\nSet up your Git identity\n\nGit uses a name and an email address to identify commits with an author (i.e., track which person is making which changes). Your Git identity is not the same as your GitHub account (we’ll talk about GitHub shortly), although both should use the same email address. Typically, you only need to set up your Git identity once per computer.\nYou can set your Git username like this:\n\n\nCode\n# define username in git\ngit config --global user.name \"Your name\"\n\n\n… and you can set the email like this:\n\n\nCode\n# define email in git\ngit config --global user.email \"your@email.com\"\n\n\n \n\nCreate a local repository\n\nNavigate to the folder where you want to keep the repository (cd) and initialize the local repository (git init):\n\n\nCode\n# example folder\ncd /path/to/my/repository\n\n# initialize local repository\ngit init\n\n\ngit init initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking\nan existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure needed for version control .\n \n\nAdd a new file\n\nCreate a new file. It can be an .R file or a README.md file describing the new repository (in this case, it’s just an example). Now we can use git status to check the current status of the project:\n\n\nCode\n# check status\ngit status\n\n\n\nNote: Git can track specific changes within a file when they are text files (non-binary files). For binary files, only the version history will be tracked.\n\n \n\nCommit changes in Git\n\nTo start tracking a new file, you must use the following command:\n\n\nCode\n# start tracking a file\ngit add filename\n\n\n \nYou can also do it for all new files like this:\n\n\nCode\n# start tracking all new files\ngit add .\n\n\n \nOnce you’ve started tracking file(s), you can commit the changes to the project’s version history:\n\n\nCode\n# commit changes\ngit commit -m \"short but explanatory message here\"\n\n\n \n\nA common workflow is to edit files in your project, add the files you want to save using the git add command, and then commit the changes to the file using the git commit command. We can also use git status to check the project’s status.\n\n\nAdd branches\n\n\nA clean way to make changes is to keep them on a parallel development line known as a “branch”\nIt’s also the safest way to work on different versions of a repository simultaneously\nBy default, the repository has a main branch considered the main version\nWe use branches to experiment and make edits before pushing them to the main branch\nBranches can maintain independent versions of the project that can later be (or not) merged into the main branch\n\n\n\n\n \nThe following code creates a new branch and activates it:\n\n\nCode\n# add a branch\ngit checkout -b new_branch\n\n\n \nNow we can make changes to the project without affecting the main branch. Once satisfied with the changes, they can be reintegrated into the main branch:\n\n\nCode\n# go back to the main branch\n git checkout master\n\n# merge new branch\ngit merge new_branch\n\n\n \n… and delete the alternate branch:\n\n\nCode\n# delete branch\ngit branch -d new_branch\n\n\n \n\nAdditional Commands to Monitor Project Status in Git\n \n\ngit log: returns a history of commits\ngit reflog: allows visualizing recent changes such as additions, commits, and branch changes\ngit diff: allows visualizing specific changes in non-binary files (i.e., text files)\ngit reset: resets the main branch to a previous state\nUse git --help to see a list of other useful commands for tracking/modifying histories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n0.2.3 Using GitHub to Host Projects\nGitHub is a platform for storing code, version control, and facilitating collaborations. It allows users to sort and save copies of code, as well as collaborate on projects related to programming remotely.\n\n0.2.3.1 Steps\n\nCreate an account on GitHub\n\n\nGo to (this address)[https://github.com/join] and click the “Create an account” button\n\n\nCreate a repository\n\n\nIn the top right corner, next to your identification icon, click “+” and then select “New repository”\nName the repository and write a brief description\nSelect “Initialize this repository with a README file” (optional but recommended)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCreate a branch\n\n\nBranches on GitHub are equivalent to those we create in Git and have the same function: running parallel versions of a project\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMerge the secondary branch\n\n\nTo merge branches, a pull request must be made\nThe pull request is a way to alert the repository owner that you want to make some changes to their code\nThe request allows reviewing the code and making sure it looks good before including the changes in the main branch. Once reviewed, the owner can decide whether to accept or reject those changes (“merge”).\n\nFirst, a pull request must be requested:\n\n\n\n \nAnd after ensuring there are no conflicts, the alternate branch and the main branch can be merged:\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n0.2.4 Git + GitHub\n\nGit-managed local repositories can be hosted and/or synchronized with remote repositories hosted on GitHub\nThis combination of tools is particularly useful for remote collaborations and for sharing code with the community\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n0.2.4.1 Steps\n\nClone the repository locally\n\n\nThis step is done using git on your computer\ngit clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely\nThe clone includes all files, history, and branches of the project\nWe can use the course repository as an example: https://github.com/maRce10/curso_reproducible\nFirst, copy the https address of the repository (https://github.com/maRce10/curso_reproducible.git)\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAnd then run git clone locally:\n\n\n\nCode\n# clone remote repository\ngit clone https://github.com/maRce10/curso_reproducible.git\n\n\n \n\nSet up the remote repository locally\n\n\n\nCode\n# enter the folder\ncd ./curso_reproducible\n\n# initialize repository in git\ngit init\n\n# set the repository address\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/maRce10/curso_reproducible.git\n\n\n \n\nSend pull requests to GitHub\n\n\nOnce you have worked on a project locally, these changes can be synchronized with the repository on GitHub\ngit pull updates the remote development line with updates from its local counterpart\nThe change must be tracked and committed to be synchronized\n\n\n\nCode\n## track new changes\ngit add .\n\n# commit changes\ngit commit -m \"local change x\"\n\n# send the first request to github\ngit pull origin master\n\n# send subsequent changes to github \n\ngit pull\n\n\n \n\nUpdate local repository\n\n\nIf there are changes from your collaborators that have been synchronized with the repository on GitHub, they can be synchronized locally using git push\ngit push updates the local development line with updates from its remote counterpart\n\n\n\nCode\n# synchronize remote changes the first time\ngit push origin master\n\n# synchronize remote changes \ngit push\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n0.2.5 Exercise 1\n\nIn your GitHub account, create a new repository\nCreate a README file remotely (on GitHub)\nClone the repository locally\nSynchronize the local repository with GitHub\nMake changes locally (e.g., add a text file) and send these changes to GitHub\n\n\n \n\n\n0.2.6 References\n\nBryan, J.
